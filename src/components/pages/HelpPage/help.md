# FAQ

###### Upload Limits

You may upload a maximum of 8 PDF documents. You can combine multiple CIPRS records into one larger PDF, using a tool such as Kofax Power PDF.

###### PDF Size Too Large

If your PDF is too large, consider deleting unnecessary pages to reduce file size.

###### PDF Info is Missing

All CIPRS records must be text-based PDFs, not image-based PDFs. Otherwise, the tool cannot search the text in the file. If you're emailing CIPRS/CCIS records to yourself from a terminal, those come in text-based PDF form. Image-based PDFs are the result of scanning a document.

If you're familiar with Adobe or Kofax's OCR (optical character recognition), you may be able to convert your non-text-based PDFs for use with the tool. Let us know if it works!

###### Required Info

You will need to enter something into the attorney/petitioner info fields, unless marked "optional." If needed, you can change this after you save the petition to your computer.

###### Editing the Generated PDF

Save the site-generated PDF to your computer and then edit. Edits within the browser may not carry over through download.
