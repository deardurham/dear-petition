# Rules

## The Robot Intern Rule

This website is a tool, and not a substitute for legal analysis by a trained human. Every petition will require review for substantive and stylistic issues.

## Forms currently supported

* AOC-CR-287 - Charges Dismissed
* AOC-CR-288 - Not Guilty
* AOC-CR-285 - Expunction Petition Attachment

## Browser

Google Chrome is the only one supported by the CFD team.

# Help

## Upload Limits

* You may upload a maximum of 8 PDF documents. You can combine multiple CIPRS records into one larger PDF.
  * Kofax Power PDF is one way of combining multiple CIPRS records into one larger PDF
* If your PDF is too large, consider deleting unnecessary pages to reduce file size.
* To upload records, you can either drag and drop to the box labelled "Upload CIPRS records," or click inside the box to open a dialogue box.

## PDF uploads

* All CIPRS records must be text-based PDFs, not image-based PDFs. Otherwise, the tool cannot search the text in the file.
  * If you're emailing CIPRS/CCIS records to yourself from a terminal, those come in text-based PDF form.
  * I think of image-based PDFs as the result of scanning a printout.
  * If you're familiar with Adobe or Kofax's OCR (optical character recognition), you may be able to convert your non-text-based PDFs for use with the tool. Let me know!

## Required Info

* You will need to enter something into the attorney/petitioner info fields, unless marked "optional."
  * You can change this after you save the petition to your computer.

## Saving and editing

Save the site-generated PDF to your computer and then edit. Edits within the browser may not carry over through download.

## Issues/Errors

* Try it again, and see if the issue repeats.
* Use codefordurhamdearproject@googlegroups.com to share any petition tool issues/errors. This allows the entire CFD team to see the issue at the same time.
  * Along with a description of the issue, include 3 files: the CIPRS record, the tool-generated petition, and the petition with the correct info. Remember that our CFD teammates are wonderfully talented non-lawyer volunteers who work backwards to solve our problems.

## Testing Phase

Anything worth having is worth fighting for. Send along your comments, issues, thoughts, suggestions. As you use it, make note of what's good, what's useful, what's cumbersome, what could be better.
