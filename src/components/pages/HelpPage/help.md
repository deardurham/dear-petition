# FAQ

###### What is the maximum number of CIPRS records I can upload at one time?

You may upload a maximum of 8 PDF documents. You can combine multiple CIPRS records into one larger PDF, using a tool such as Kofax Power PDF.

###### What do I do if my PDF file is too large?

If your PDF is too large, consider deleting unnecessary pages to reduce file size.

###### Why is info missing from the generated petition file?

All CIPRS records must be text-based PDFs, not image-based PDFs. Otherwise, the tool cannot search the text in the file. If you're emailing CIPRS/CCIS records to yourself from a terminal, those come in text-based PDF form. Image-based PDFs are the result of scanning a document.

If you're familiar with Adobe or Kofax's OCR (optical character recognition), you may be able to convert your non-text-based PDFs for use with the tool. Let us know if it works!

###### What if I am not sure about all the petitioner info I am submitting to the website?

You will need to enter something into the attorney/petitioner info fields, unless marked "optional." If needed, you can change the information after you save the petition to your computer. See "How do I edit the site-generated PDF?"

###### How do I edit the site-generated PDF?

Save the site-generated PDF to your computer and then edit. Edits within the browser may not carry over through download.
